# Grade Analysis System
A command-line interface app which is built in **C** for processing, analyzing, and ranking academic performance data. This project uses low-level systems programming concepts

## features
* **Dynamic Record Handling**: Manages as many number of student records needed, by using dynamic memory allocation
* **Recursive Calculation**: Implements a recursive way to compute final weighted percentages based on course components
* **Stats Analysis**: Calculates class stats including **Maximum**, **Average**, and **Median** scores
* **Search & Rank Functionality**: Includes a built-in sorting system using qsort, with a custom comparator for class rankings and a name-based search module for quick data retrieval

## Technical Stack
* **Language**: C
* **Libraries**: `stdio.h`, `stdbool.h`, `stdlib.h`, `string.h`, `math.h`
* **Core Concepts** include Memory Management, pointer arithmetic & structs, recursion, buffer management

## To Run
* Compile the program, make sure to have an environemnt which supports C
* run the executable

NOTE: I used GCC, and had Ubuntu setup on my system when creating and testing
